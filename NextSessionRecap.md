## RECAP
- At Sablemarket Cay, the crew faced competing pressures: a Company “exclusive” offer, a Navy inquiry into Ben’s berth, and an auctioned chart to the Sunken Crown.
- Rival captain Gullknife Sable watched the action from the front row, ready to counter.
- Councilor “Old Salt” Merrow was seen on the Cay: weather-worn, pragmatic, with a dull-glinting glass eye and a low, economical voice.
- The most recent scene opened in a different location: an upstairs room at the Broken Anvil during a rainy night.
- A lock clicked and the door began to open—slow, careful, professional.
- Mara signaled silence and warned there may be more in the hall.

## CURRENT SITUATION
- You are in **upstairs room #3** at **the Broken Anvil** as an intruder opens the door only a palm’s width.
- The hallway beyond is dim, with weak yellow light farther down; you smell wet wool and old smoke.
- Mara is poised and whisper-quiet, watching the latch and listening.

## OPEN THREADS
- Who is trying to enter room #3, and how many are in the hall?
- What happened between Sablemarket Cay and the Broken Anvil to put you here?
- The Sunken Crown chart’s low-tide deadline (three days) still looms.
- The Company’s “exclusive week” offer remains unresolved.
- The Navy’s interest in Ben’s berth suggests an imminent hunt or trap.
