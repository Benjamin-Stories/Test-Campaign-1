# Current Scene State (Cliffhanger)

## Where we are (exact location)
- Upstairs room #3 at the Broken Anvil (interior), by a door leading to a hallway; a window is behind Mara.

## When it is (date/time if known)
- Unknown (it is raining; lanternlit conditions suggest nighttime, but not explicitly stated).

## Who is present (and where they are positioned if relevant)
- Player character: In room #3, position not precisely stated; close enough for Mara to lean near their ear.
- Mara: In room #3 near the window/door line; eyes fixed on the latch; hand raised with two fingers in a warning gesture; leans to whisper near the player’s ear.
- Unknown intruder: In the hallway outside room #3; partially visible as a shoulder-first shape in the door crack; moving carefully/professionally; currently paused listening.
- Possible additional figures: Unknown (“there’s more in the hall,” per Mara).

## Immediate situation / tension (what is happening right now)
- Someone is entering room #3 cautiously: the lock has clicked, the handle is turning, and the door is open a palm-width. Mara warns the player to stay quiet and suggests multiple people may be in the hallway.

## What just happened (last 5–15 story beats, in order)
1. The lock to upstairs room #3 at the Broken Anvil clicked open.
2. Inside the cramped, warm room, rain ticked at the window behind Mara; lanternlight trembled from a draft under the door.
3. Mara raised a silent warning (two fingers) and watched the latch without looking away.
4. The handle turned slowly, testing; the door pressed inward slightly.
5. Mara whispered to the player: “Don’t breathe loud… If it’s who I think, there’s more in the hall.”
6. The door opened to a palm-width, revealing a dim hallway with weak yellow light from farther down.
7. The smell of wet wool and old smoke drifted in.
8. A shape edged into the gap shoulder-first and then paused to listen.

## What is unresolved (threads that must carry into next session)
- The identity, intent, and number of the intruders in the hallway.
- What Mara means by “if it’s who I think.”
- Whether there is a map in the room (implied only by the offered option to hide it) and what happens to it next.

## What must NOT be contradicted next session (hard continuity locks)
- We are in upstairs room #3 at the Broken Anvil; it is raining outside; lanternlight is present and drafty under the door.
- The lock has already been opened; the handle has turned; the door is already open about a palm-width.
- Mara is present, silent-warning posture established, and has warned there may be more people in the hall.
- The intruder is being careful/professional and is currently paused listening in the doorway crack.

## Immediate next expected moment (what the very next scene should open with)
- The player’s immediate reaction to the partially opened door (stay still, rush the door, coordinate with Mara, or speak/bluff), as the intruder listens and decides whether to enter further.
