# Session Logs

## Session 1 — Opener Scene: “The Auction of Rumors” (2026-02-02)
**Location:** Sablemarket Cay (pirate bazaar)

### What happened (at table)
- The scene was established: humid night at Sablemarket Cay’s floating shanty-bazaar, lanternlit and creaking with the swell; the crew nearby, tense and hungry after a poor take.
- A crier ran an auction of “secrets” sealed in glass bottles—rumors, maps, and names “guaranteed true.”
- Three immediate pressures were presented simultaneously:
  - A Company courier offered: **Factor Lysa Quell will “buy your next week—exclusive.”**
  - A Navy lieutenant in a plain coat quietly asked the auctioneer for **“Ben the Muster’s current berth.”**
  - A sealed bottle drew bids: **a chart to the Sunken Crown**, with a deadline: **low tide in three days**.
- Rival captain **Joryn “Gullknife” Sable** was spotted in the front row, smiling as if ready to counter whatever move Ben makes.
- **Councilor “Old Salt” Merrow** was described on-site: older, weather-worn, practical officewear; carries political balance like shipboard balance; notable **glass eye**; low, plain voice; a man who keeps the harbor running.

### Scene options on the table
1. Push into the auction and bid hard for the Sunken Crown chart.
2. Peel off to negotiate the Company’s “exclusive” offer.
3. Shadow the Navy lieutenant and learn who’s hunting Ben and why.
4. Fall back to the sloop, rally officers, and decide as a crew.

## Session 0 — Setup & Canon (2026-01-31)
**Purpose:** establish ship details, crew officers, table lines/veils, and the first pressures.

### Canon decisions (initial)
- **Captain:** Ben “the Muster” (PC or central NPC).
- **Ship:** small sloop; fast, shallow-draft.
- **Crew:** 40.
- **Operating area:** Sapphire Archipelago (Free Harbors, Company ports, Crown patrols).
- **Magic:** sea-witchcraft exists; oath-based and costly.

### Session 0 prompts (answer at table)
1. **Ship name + rumor:** What is the sloop called, and what do dockhands whisper about it?
2. **Why “the Muster”:** How did Ben earn the title?
3. **The Articles:** What’s one rule the crew will remember Ben by (fair share? no torture? no slaves? never leave a mate?)
4. **A debt:** Who do you owe—coin, favor, or oath?
5. **A rival:** Which captain/official wants you embarrassed more than dead?

### Immediate pressures (pick or roll)
- You’re **short on supplies** (powder or food).
- A **crew dispute** is about to turn violent.
- The **Company** offers a job that smells like a trap.
- The **Crown** posts a fresh bounty with Ben’s likeness.

## Session 1 — Opener Scene: “The Auction of Rumors”
**Date:** (set at play)

### Cold open (start here)
Night in **Sablemarket Cay**. Lanterns swing over a floating bazaar stitched from lashed hulls and salvaged docks. A crowd gathers around a crier selling secrets in sealed bottles—**rumors, maps, and names**, each “guaranteed true.”

Your sloop lies moored close enough to smell the tar. The crew is restless: **pay is thin**, and the last raid was more bruises than profit.

Then three things happen at once:
1. A Company agent’s courier pushes through the crowd and hisses: **“Factor Quell will buy your next week—exclusive.”**
2. A Navy lieutenant (plain coat, sharp eyes) quietly asks the auctioneer for **“Ben the Muster’s current berth.”**
3. A sealed bottle is raised high: **“A chart to the Sunken Crown—low tide in three days.”** Bidding starts… and your rival **Gullknife Sable** smiles at you from the front row.

### What’s at stake right now
- Secure a lead to real treasure (or a powerful curse).
- Avoid immediate arrest/ambush.
- Keep your crew from fracturing over fear and hunger.

### Player options (choose 2–4 to pursue)
1. **Buy or steal the bottle**: win the bidding, swap it, cut the cord, or pickpocket the auctioneer.
2. **Make a deal with the Company courier**: accept “exclusive work” for supplies and heat reduction—or set a counter-terms trap.
3. **Shadow the Navy lieutenant**: identify who tipped them off and feed them false information.
4. **Confront Gullknife Sable**: duel of words or steel; bargain, threaten, or publicly humiliate.

### GM notes (improv prompts)
- If the bottle breaks: the “map” is a **skin-scrap chart** that sticks to whoever touches it first.
- If the players stall: a fight erupts—someone yells **“NAVY!”** and the crowd stampedes.
- If they win cleanly: the auctioneer demands a **favor** instead of coin.
