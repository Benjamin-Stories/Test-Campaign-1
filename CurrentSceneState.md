# Current Scene State (Cliffhanger)

## Where we are (exact location)
- On a city street at night, near a corner with an awning dripping beside a notice board sagging under damp parchment; wet paving stones and wagon ruts visible in lanternlight halos.

## When it is (date/time if known)
- Night, close to curfew. Exact date/time: Unknown.

## Who is present (and where they are positioned if relevant)
- Player character (disguised as an ordinary traveler) standing in the street, stopped.
- One lone city guard, stepped out from under the awning and positioned in front of the player, blocking/stopping them.
- Late foot traffic (dockhands, two clerks sharing an umbrella, a fishwife with an empty basket) flowing around them.

## What each present NPC/group personally witnessed or heard in this scene (knowledge anchors)
- City guard
  - Witnessed/heard: Sees the player as “just another traveler” in the street near curfew; has done a quick practical once-over (boots, hands, coat line, any obvious weapon-bulge).
  - Explicitly told (by whom), if any: None.
  - Not present for / NOT confirmed they know: Player’s secret identity as heir to the throne; anything about the player beyond what is visible right now; any prior events involving the player.
- Late foot traffic (dockhands / two clerks / fishwife)
  - Witnessed/heard: Unknown (they are described as flowing around, not stopping).
  - Explicitly told (by whom), if any: None.
  - Not present for / NOT confirmed they know: Anything specific about the player/guard interaction beyond what they might casually pass by.
- Player character
  - Witnessed/heard: The guard has stated curfew is close and there have been pickpockets on this stretch; the guard is asking where the player is headed, where they came in from, their name, and whether they have lodging papers / which house or inn they’re staying at.

## Immediate situation / tension (what is happening right now)
- The guard is conducting a routine near-curfew street stop and is waiting for the player’s answers; the player must decide how to respond (truth, vagueness, papers, refusal).

## What just happened (last 5–15 story beats, in order)
1. Mist needles down; lanternlight forms halos; wet street stones shine and wagon ruts cut grooves.
2. The player moves with late-night foot traffic as an ordinary-looking traveler.
3. A lone city guard steps out from under an awning and stops the player with a raised palm, professional and tired.
4. The guard performs a quick, practical visual check for trouble (boots, hands, coat line, weapon-bulge), showing no recognition.
5. The guard says curfew is close and mentions pickpockets working this stretch.
6. The guard asks the player where they’re headed, where they came in from, their name, and whether they have lodging papers / which house or inn they’re staying at.
7. The scene pauses on the guard waiting for the player’s reply.

## Sensitive facts mentioned this scene (and who heard them)
- “Curfew’s close” and “pickpockets working this stretch”: said by the city guard; heard by the player character. Whether passersby heard: Unknown.
- Player is secretly the heir to the throne but disguised with nothing visible to reveal it: stated out-of-world by the player; not stated in-world to any NPCs in this scene.

## What is unresolved (threads that must carry into next session)
- How the player answers the guard’s questions (name, origin, destination, lodging/papers).
- Whether the guard escalates (insists, demands papers, detains) depending on the player’s response.

## What must NOT be contradicted next session (hard continuity locks)
- Location remains the same city street corner by the awning and notice board in misty lanternlit night conditions.
- Only one city guard is currently stopping the player; he is a stranger and has no prior knowledge of the player.
- The guard has not recognized the player; nothing visible reveals the player’s secret identity.
- The guard’s stated reason for the stop: curfew soon and pickpockets reported on this stretch.
- The guard is currently awaiting answers about destination, origin, name, and lodging papers/inn.

## Immediate next expected moment (what the very next scene should open with)
- The guard holds position and waits as the player begins to answer (or refuses), prompting the guard’s immediate reaction.
