## LAST SESSION SUMMARY
On a misty night street near curfew, a lone city guard performed a routine stop of a traveler, citing recent pickpockets and asking standard identification and lodging questions.

## RECAP
- Misty night, lantern halos, wet stone streets, late foot traffic.
- A city guard stepped out from under an awning and halted the traveler.
- The guard gave a quick, practical once-over for weapons/trouble.
- He cited curfew approaching and pickpockets working the area.
- He asked for name, where you came from, where you’re headed, and lodging details/papers.

## CURRENT SITUATION
- You’re stopped in the street with the guard waiting on your answers.
- Pedestrians continue to pass by without paying much attention.
- The guard is firm but not hostile—yet.

## OPEN THREADS
- What identity (and paperwork, if any) you present to get waved through.
- Whether the guard’s pickpocket warning is routine… or a pretext for something else.
- How this street-level scrutiny connects (if at all) to bigger faction pressures elsewhere.
