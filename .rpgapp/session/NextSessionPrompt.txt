Continue at Sablemarket Cay mid-auction. Present the three pressures (Sunken Crown chart with 3-day low-tide deadline; Quell’s “exclusive week” offer; Navy lieutenant asking after Ben’s berth) and put Gullknife Sable and Councilor Merrow in play. Ask the crew’s immediate move, then escalate with either a bid war, a private negotiation, or a near-discovery by the lieutenant.
