# Campaign Bible (Core): *Sails of the Sapphire Archipelago*

## 1) Setting overview
The **Sapphire Archipelago** is a broad chain of islands scattered across warm currents and treacherous reefs. Trade routes thread between coral mazes, hidden coves, and deep-water channels watched by forts.

Three powers struggle for control:
- The **Crown** claims lawful dominion.
- The **Eastwater Company** claims profit and “order.”
- The **Free Harbors League** claims sanctuary—so long as you pay, vote, or bleed for it.

Pirates thrive in the gaps: the uncharted, the disputed, the storm-torn.

## 2) Tone
**Swashbuckling adventure with consequential choices.**
- High energy: chases, boarding, duels, daring rescues.
- Grounded pressure: supplies, morale, betrayal, politics.
- Weird edge: sea-omens, oath-magic, and old ruins surface when the tide is wrong.

## 3) Themes
- **Freedom vs. responsibility**: the crew needs pay, safety, and a captain worth following.
- **Reputation is currency**: fear opens doors and closes them.
- **The sea remembers**: debts, oaths, and curses echo.
- **Maps lie**: every chart is propaganda or guesswork.

## 4) Rules of the sea (in-world laws)
1. **Articles matter**: crews follow captains who keep the code (pay shares, settle disputes, bury the dead).
2. **Ports have prices**: every harbor demands bribes, favors, or vows.
3. **Flags are masks**: privateers, pirates, and merchants swap identities constantly.
4. **No ship is an island**: every raid changes faction balances.

## 5) Factions
### The Crown Navy
**Goal:** restore “law” and tax the sea lanes.
- Strengths: disciplined crews, superior cannon, warrants, informant network.
- Weaknesses: politics, slow bureaucracy, pride.
- Faces: *Commodore Alaric Vane* (ruthless), *Lt. Mirelda Soot* (clever hunter).

### Eastwater Company
**Goal:** monopolize trade, insurance, and salvage rights.
- Strengths: coin, mercenaries, port contracts, legal cover.
- Weaknesses: internal rivalries, paper trails, arrogance.
- Faces: *Factor Lysa Quell* (smiling knife), *Captain-Contractor Rusk* (corporate privateer).

### Free Harbors League
**Goal:** keep pirate havens independent—on the League’s terms.
- Strengths: sanctuary ports, fences, shipyards, information.
- Weaknesses: factional councils, vendettas, corruption.
- Faces: *Councilor “Old Salt” Merrow* (pragmatist), *Arbitrator Nemi Vale* (code-enforcer).

### Rival Captains (the Blackwake Circle)
A loose fraternity of notorious flags.
- They feud, ally, and vote to declare a “common enemy.”
- Faces: *Captain Joryn “Gullknife” Sable* (duelist), *Captain Mother Rill* (matriarch of cutthroats).

### The Tideborn Covenant (sea-mystics)
**Goal:** recover relics and bind the archipelago with oaths to “keep the deep asleep.”
- Offers blessings (wind, concealment) for prices (secrets, names, vows).
- Faces: *Sister Brine*, *The Drowned Scribe*.

## 6) Geography explaining play
### Major regions
- **The Brightwater Run**: main trade corridor; richest targets, highest patrol density.
- **The Needle Reefs**: labyrinthine shallows; perfect for ambushes and escapes.
- **Gallowsweather Belt**: recurring squalls and fog; ships vanish, wrecks rise.
- **The Sunken Crown**: ruins visible at extreme low tide; rumored pre-Crown civilization.

### Notable ports (headline only)
- **Port Scathe** (Free Harbor): sanctuary with fees and politics.
- **Crownhold Fort** (Crown): garrisoned anchorage and court of admiralty.
- **Quellspire** (Company): warehouses, contracts, and “legal salvage.”
- **Sablemarket Cay** (pirate bazaar): fences, duels, and rumor auctions.

## 7) Ships & sailing assumptions
- A **sloop** is fast, shallow-draft, and deadly in boarding—but fragile under sustained broadside.
- Sea combat often resolves into **positioning + morale**: who controls range, wind, and fear.

## 8) Magic: Sea-witchcraft (common enough to matter)
Magic is **oath-and-price** based.
- **How it works:** spoken vows, carved sigils, offerings, true names.
- **What it can do:** steer winds briefly, hide a ship in fog, curse a rival’s luck, bind a promise.
- **Costs:** debt to the Covenant, sacrifice of valuables, or permanent “marks” (salt scars, blackened nails, haunted dreams).
- **Hard limit:** it cannot create something from nothing—every blessing shifts burden elsewhere.

## 9) Starting canon (anchor facts)
- **Captain:** Ben “the Muster.”
- **Ship:** a small sloop (name TBD in play).
- **Crew:** ~40.
- **Current pressure:** bounties are rising; the Company is buying informants in Free Harbors.
