# Current Scene State (Cliffhanger)

## Where we are (exact location)
- Unknown city street at night in rainy/misty weather, lit by lanterns; wet street stones with wagon ruts; near an awning and a notice board on a corner.

## When it is (date/time if known)
- Night. Exact date/time unknown. (Transcript timestamp for this exchange: 2026-02-03 22:16, but in-world time not explicitly confirmed.)

## Who is present (and where they are positioned if relevant)
- Player character (disguised as an ordinary traveler; secretly the heir to the throne) — standing in the street amid late-night foot traffic.
- One unnamed city guard — stepped out from under an awning and is stopping the PC; one hand up (palm out), the other resting near a short baton at his belt.
- Late street crowd (dockhands heading home, two clerks under an umbrella, a fishwife with an empty basket, and general passersby) — moving past in the background; nobody stopping to watch.

## What each present NPC/group personally witnessed or heard in this scene (knowledge anchors)
- Unnamed city guard
  - Witnessed/heard: Sees the PC as “just another traveler” in the late crowd; visually checks boots/hands/coat line/possible weapon bulges; observes it’s near curfew and mentions pickpockets on this stretch.
  - Explicitly told (by whom), if any: None.
  - Not present for / NOT confirmed they know: PC’s true identity as heir to the throne; any prior history with the PC; anything about the PC beyond what he can infer from appearance/behavior right now.
- Late street crowd (passersby)
  - Witnessed/heard: Continue moving; no one stops or stares; the guard is conducting a normal stop/check.
  - Explicitly told (by whom), if any: None.
  - Not present for / NOT confirmed they know: PC’s identity; details of the guard’s questions beyond what they might overhear in passing (not explicitly stated).
- Player character (PC)
  - Witnessed/heard: Guard calls out “Traveler,” stops them, cites curfew nearing and pickpockets; asks where the PC is headed/where they came in from; asks for name and any papers for lodging/which house they’re staying at.
  - Explicitly told (by whom), if any: Guard states curfew is close and there have been pickpockets working this stretch.
  - Not present for / NOT confirmed they know: Any additional context behind the guard’s patrol beyond what the guard said.

## Immediate situation / tension (what is happening right now)
- A routine street stop: the guard is questioning the PC for identity/destination/lodging papers due to near-curfew conditions and recent pickpocket activity; the crowd continues around them. The PC must respond.

## What just happened (last 5–15 story beats, in order)
1. Rain eases into a thin mist, making lanternlight haloed; the street is slick and reflective with wagon ruts.
2. The PC moves with the late-night crowd, blending in as an ordinary traveler.
3. A city guard steps out from under an awning and calls, “Ho there. You. Traveler.”
4. The guard signals the PC to stop (palm out), with his other hand near a baton; demeanor is tired but firm, not aggressive.
5. The guard visually checks the PC for signs of trouble/weapons and shows no recognition.
6. The guard says curfew is close and mentions pickpockets on this stretch; asks where the PC is headed and where they came in from.
7. The guard asks the PC’s name and whether they have papers for lodging/which house they’re staying at.
8. Scene pauses on the guard awaiting the PC’s answer.

## Sensitive facts mentioned this scene (and who heard them)
- PC is secretly the heir to the throne, disguised as an ordinary traveler; nothing visible reveals identity; nobody has told the guard; the guard has not witnessed anything about the PC before this moment.
  - Heard/known by: Only the player/PC (presented as player-provided framing). Not known by the guard or crowd per the transcript.

## What is unresolved (threads that must carry into next session)
- How the PC responds to the guard’s questions (name, origin/destination, lodging papers).
- Whether the interaction stays routine, escalates (e.g., refusal/attempt to leave), or becomes an opportunity to learn about curfew/pickpockets.

## What must NOT be contradicted next session (hard continuity locks)
- The guard is a stranger to the PC and has no prior knowledge of them.
- There is nothing visible revealing the PC’s identity; the guard has not been told and has not witnessed anything about the PC before this moment.
- The guard’s behavior is normal/professional: tired but firm, conducting a routine check near curfew with pickpocket concerns; not aggressive by default.
- The location remains the same rainy/misty lanternlit street with the late-night crowd continuing past.

## Immediate next expected moment (what the very next scene should open with)
- The guard waits for the PC’s answer—PC must give a name and explain where they’re headed/where they came from and whether they have lodging papers (or choose to evade/refuse), and the guard reacts accordingly.
