## RECAP
- The crew arrived at **Sablemarket Cay** at night, a lanternlit floating bazaar built from lashed salvage.
- A crier began auctioning “secrets” in sealed glass bottles: rumors, maps, and names.
- A Company courier offered work: **Factor Lysa Quell will buy your next week—exclusive**.
- A Navy lieutenant in a plain coat quietly asked the auctioneer for **Ben the Muster’s current berth**.
- The biggest lure hit the block: **a chart to the Sunken Crown**, with **low tide in three days**.
- Rival captain **Joryn “Gullknife” Sable** watched from the front row, smiling.
- **Councilor “Old Salt” Merrow** was spotted nearby: weather-worn, pragmatic, with a notable **glass eye** and a low, economical voice.

## CURRENT SITUATION
- You’re in the crowd at Sablemarket Cay as the Sunken Crown bottle draws bids.
- Company, Crown, and pirate rivals are all within arm’s reach.
- Your crew is restless and watching for your call.

## OPEN THREADS
- Do you **win/steal** the Sunken Crown chart (and what price will it demand)?
- Do you **hear out or refuse** Quell’s “exclusive week,” and on what terms?
- Do you **trail or mislead** the Navy lieutenant hunting Ben’s berth?
- What does **Gullknife Sable** plan to do if you move on any of the above?
- Is **Merrow** here as an observer, a broker, or to enforce League interests?
