# Ben the Muster — *Sails of the Sapphire Archipelago*

## Quick pitch
You are **Captain Ben “the Muster”**, commanding a **small, fast sloop** with a **crew of 40** in the **Sapphire Archipelago**—a reef-choked chain of free ports, company forts, and imperial patrol lanes. Keep the ship afloat, keep the crew loyal, and stay one step ahead of the **Crown Navy** and the **Eastwater Company** while chasing rumor-heavy treasure and inconvenient truths.

## What this campaign is about
- **Swashbuckling piracy with hard choices**: daring raids, negotiations in smoky taverns, and the cost of leadership.
- **Faction pressure**: every score shifts the balance between Navy, Company, Free Harbors, and rival captains.
- **Sea-witchcraft (optional but present)**: curses, oaths, and weather-magic exist—powerful, never free.

## How to run/play (GM + players)
### Table expectations
- **Action-forward** sessions that begin with a situation, not a reminder.
- **Player-driven goals**: choose jobs, targets, alliances, and what “freedom” means.
- **Consequences matter**: heat/notoriety, damage, debts, and reputations carry over.

### Core loop
1. **Dock**: gather rumors, recruit, repair, pay crew, negotiate.
2. **Choose a score**: raid, smuggle, rescue, heist, hunt a relic.
3. **Sail**: hazards, pursuit, strange omens.
4. **Clash**: boarding action, tense parley, or running fight.
5. **Aftermath**: loot division, injuries, faction reactions, new complications.

### Minimal rules guidance (system-agnostic)
Use your preferred RPG engine. If you need lightweight mechanics, treat these as recurring trackers:
- **Ship Integrity (0–10)**: 10 pristine; 0 sinking.
- **Crew Morale (0–10)**: pay, food, victories raise it; fear/hunger/defeat drop it.
- **Notoriety (0–10)**: higher = more attention, bigger bounties, tighter ports.
- **Supplies (0–10)**: food, shot, powder, sailcloth, medicine.

### Starting premise for characters
Players are officers/featured crew under Captain Ben (or alternate PCs, with Ben as an NPC captain). Suggested roles:
- Quartermaster (crew politics), Boatswain (ship upkeep), Navigator (charts), Gunner (ordnance), Surgeon (medicine), Master-at-arms (boarding), Face (port deals), Occultist (oaths/curses).
