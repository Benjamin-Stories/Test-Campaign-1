  "style_name": "Cinematic nautical realism (gritty swashbuckling)",
  "style_prompt": "Semi-realistic cinematic illustration with sharp detail in faces, weathered materials, and period seafaring gear.\nWarm lanternlight and tropical moonlight contrasted with cold storm-fog; strong rim light, sea-spray atmosphere, dramatic clouds.\nPalette: deep sapphire/teal seas, tar blacks, oxidized brass, sun-bleached wood, with crimson accents for flags/blood/oaths.\nMood: adventurous tension—dynamic poses, wind in cloth/rigging, subtle eerie hints (sigils, salt-scars, drowned ruins) without going full horror.",
  "avoid": "Avoid cartoon/chibi proportions, flat cel shading, or overly clean/modern materials.\nAvoid text, UI overlays, watermarks, and extreme gore; keep magic effects subtle and physical (fog, carved marks, glints).",
