What's the current scene?

[2026-01-31 18:24:28] GM:
Night presses down warm and wet over Sablemarket Cay, turning the air into something you can almost drink. Lanterns sway on ropes strung between scavenged masts and broken hulls, their light smearing across black water and oil-slick planks. The whole bazaar floats—stitched together from lashed docks and salvage—creaking softly every time a wave breathes under it.

A crowd knots tight around a raised crate where a crier is selling secrets sealed in glass bottles: rumors, maps, names. Each one held up to the light like a jewel, each one promised “guaranteed true,” and you can feel your crew nearby—restless, watching, counting the days since the last take that left more bruises than coin. Your sloop sits moored close enough that the tar and wet rope are in your nose.

Then the night splits three ways at once. A Company courier shoulders through, close enough to hiss in your ear: “Factor Quell will buy your next week—exclusive.” At the same time, a Navy lieutenant in a plain coat leans toward the auctioneer and asks, quiet as a knife, for “Ben the Muster’s current berth.” And above it all, the crier raises a sealed bottle high—inside, a rolled chart gleams pale—calling out: “A chart to the Sunken Crown—low tide in three days.” Bidding starts immediately.

From the front row, your rival—Gullknife Sable—tilts his head and smiles at you like he already knows what you’re going to do.

1) Push through to the bottle-auction and bid hard before Gullknife can.  
2) Peel off toward the Company courier and hear what “exclusive” really costs.  
3) Shadow the Navy lieutenant, find out why he’s asking after Ben the Muster.  
4) Ignore all of it and go back to the sloop to rally your officers and make a call as a crew.

What do you do?

Explain the scene

[2026-01-31 18:30:06] GM:
You’re on Sablemarket Cay at night—a floating shanty-bazaar stitched together from scavenged docks, broken hulls, and lashed timbers. It’s humid, crowded, and unstable underfoot, lanternlight sliding across black water while everything creaks and shifts with the swell. Your sloop is moored close, so you’re not far from safety, but you’re in the crush of people and opportunity.

At the center of the commotion, a crier is running an auction of “secrets” sealed in glass bottles. The spectacle is the point: bottles lifted to the light, buyers jostling, promises of truth. Your crew is nearby, tense and hungry—watching you to see what direction you choose after a rough run that didn’t pay.

Three threads hit you at once, each pulling hard:
A Company courier slips in close and offers you a deal: Factor Quell will “buy your next week—exclusive,” meaning money and protection now, but you’d be tied to whatever job Quell wants and shut off from other work.
A Navy lieutenant, trying to stay unnoticed in a plain coat, quietly asks the auctioneer where “Ben the Muster” is berthed—suggesting the Navy is hunting someone, and you might be able to leverage that information or get caught in it.
And the crier unveils the biggest lure: a chart to the Sunken Crown, with a time pressure—low tide in three days—so whoever wins it gets a narrow window to act.

Your rival, Gullknife Sable, is in the front row already smiling at you, like he’s ready to counter whatever move you make—outbid you, undercut you, or follow you to the prize.

1) Shoulder into the auction and go after the Sunken Crown chart.  
2) Step aside with the courier and learn the real terms of Quell’s “exclusive.”  
3) Trail the Navy lieutenant and dig into who Ben the Muster is and why he’s wanted.  
4) Fall back to your sloop, pull your officers in close, and decide as a crew.

Which thread do you grab first?

Can you describe Councilor Merrow for mer?

[2026-02-01 19:38:43] GM:
You spot Councilor “Old Salt” Merrow where the Cay’s lanternlight can’t quite decide what to do with him—half swallowed by shadow, half caught in a slick sheen off the water. He’s older, weather-worn in the way dock-timber gets: grain raised, corners knocked down, still solid. His clothes are good enough to signal office but cut for function—salt-dark coat, practical boots, nothing that can snag on rigging. He carries himself like a man who’s spent a lifetime keeping his balance on moving boards and in moving politics.

The thing everyone notices first is the glass eye. It doesn’t catch light the way the other one does; it holds it, dull and steady, like a marble left at the bottom of a cup. When he turns his head, that eye doesn’t quite turn with the same softness—so you always know exactly when he’s decided to look at you.

Up close, his mouth is a hard line that loosens only when he’s making a point, and even then it’s more calculation than warmth. His voice—when it comes—is low and plain, the kind that doesn’t waste words because words cost. He doesn’t look like a man who enjoys threats. He looks like a man who keeps the harbor running anyway.

1) Approach Merrow openly and ask what he wants tonight.  
2) Watch from a distance and see who comes to him—and what they pay.  
3) Try to catch a whispered word from his aides or guards nearby.  

How do you want to handle him?

The lock gives with a soft, traitorous click.

In the cramped warmth of upstairs room #3 at the Broken Anvil, the sound lands like a dropped coin in a church. Rain ticks and drags at the window behind Mara, and the lanternlight in the room trembles as a draft snakes in under the door. Mara’s hand is already up, two fingers held tight together in a sharp, silent warning. Her eyes don’t leave the latch.

The handle turns, slow at first—testing. The door presses inward a hair, wood whispering against the frame. Whoever’s out there doesn’t shove. They’re careful. Professional careful.

Mara leans just enough to put her mouth near your ear without moving the rest of her body. “Don’t breathe loud,” she murmurs, barely sound at all. “If it’s who I think, there’s more in the hall.”

The door opens the width of a palm. A thin slice of the hallway appears: darker than your room, lit by a weak, yellow spill from somewhere farther down. You catch the smell of wet wool and old smoke. A shape blocks the gap—shoulder first—then pauses, listening.

What do you do?

1) Stay absolutely still and let them commit to entering.  
2) Rush the door the instant it widens—slam it and grab whoever’s on the other side.  
3) Whisper to Mara to hide the map while you take position to ambush.  
4) Speak softly through the crack, trying to bluff that the room is occupied by someone dangerous.

A random city guard who has never met me stops me on the street.
Important: I am secretly the heir to the throne, but I'm disguised as an ordinary traveler and there is NOTHING visible that would reveal my identity. Nobody has told the guard. The guard has not witnessed anything about me before this moment.

Play the scene. The guard should act like a normal guard with limited knowledge.

[2026-02-03 22:12:35] GM:
The door stays a palm-width open, breathing hallway air into the room. The shape outside doesn’t push in yet.

Somewhere down the corridor, floorboards complain—another weight shifting. Mara’s warning makes a kind of awful sense.

Then a voice, not right at the crack but close enough to carry, says, “Lanterntime patrol. Open up.”

A beat later, boot leather scuffs. The shoulder at the gap pulls back slightly, and the angle changes—like someone making room for a uniformed man to step into the best position to be heard. A thin wedge of the hallway widens just enough for you to catch the outline of a city guard’s sleeve and the dull glint of a badge in the weak yellow light.

“Come on,” the guard adds, impatient but not panicked. “Inn’s supposed to keep doors latched. We had a report of a scuffle upstairs. Who’s in there?”

Mara doesn’t look at you. She keeps her gaze locked on the latch and the sliver of hall beyond it, breathing shallow through her nose. Her raised fingers lower a fraction, then hold—still warning, still quiet.

The guard shifts again. You hear the small sounds of a working man on duty: a throat cleared, the faint clack of something on his belt—truncheon or ring of keys. “Open it proper,” he says. “Or I’m coming in.”

1) Stay silent and let the guard decide to enter, setting up an ambush if he crosses the threshold.  
2) Speak through the crack, calm and ordinary, and ask what this is about—try to keep him in the hall.  
3) Open the door just enough to show your hands and de-escalate, watching the hallway for the “more” Mara warned about.  
4) Whisper to Mara to slip to the window while you distract the guard at the door.  

What do you do?

[2026-02-03 22:16:25] GM:
The rain has eased into a thin, needling mist that turns lanternlight into halos. Street stones shine slick black; wagon ruts hold little mirrors of bruised-yellow light. You move with the late crowd—dockhands heading home, a pair of clerks arguing under one umbrella, a fishwife with an empty basket—just another traveler with road dust on your hems and no one’s attention lingering.

“Ho there. You. Traveler.”

A city guard steps out from under an awning as if he’s been carved from it—average height, broad through the shoulders, helmet damp, cloak dark with rain. His hand is up, palm out, the other resting near a short baton at his belt. Not aggressive. Just practiced.

“Hold a moment,” he says, voice tired but firm. He looks you over the way a man checks a cartwheel: boots, hands, the line of your coat, any obvious bulge where a blade shouldn’t be. His gaze doesn’t sharpen with recognition—there isn’t any. To him you’re simply someone who could be trouble, or could be nothing at all.

“Curfew’s close,” he goes on, nodding toward the nearest corner where a notice board sags under wet parchment. “And we’ve had pickpockets working this stretch. Where you headed, and where’d you come in from?”

Behind him, the street keeps moving. No one stops. No one stares. A normal check, in a normal city, by a guard who’s probably been on his feet too long.

He shifts his weight, boots squeaking faintly on the wet stone. “Name?” he adds, not unkindly. “And do you have any papers for lodging? If you’re staying the night, I’ll want to know which house.”

1) Answer plainly with your traveler’s name and destination, keeping it simple.  
2) Offer a polite excuse and try to step around him, testing whether he’ll insist.  
3) Ask what’s happened—pickpockets, curfew—play curious and gather information.  
4) Produce whatever travel or lodging paper you have (real or forged) and watch his reaction closely.  

What do you do?
