# GM Secrets (Do Not Share)

## Hidden truths (campaign engines)
1. **The Sunken Crown isn’t just ruins**: it’s the upper ring of an ancient tidal city built to **bind a sleeping deep-thing**. The bind is weakening.
2. **Sea-witchcraft is debt accounting**: every “blessing” is recorded somewhere—specifically in **The Drowned Ledger**, a semi-sentient relic that ensures payment.
3. **Factor Lysa Quell funds piracy on purpose**: she is manufacturing chaos to justify Company “security” takeovers of Free Harbors.
4. **Commodore Vane’s obsession is personal**: Ben once disrupted a covert Navy operation (or embarrassed Vane in court). Vane will burn resources to end Ben.

## The bottle-map twist (Session 1)
- The chart is real but incomplete.
- It is keyed to a **true name** (ship or captain). Without the name, it misleads.
- Touching it marks the holder with a subtle **salt-scar** that Tideborn seers can read.

## Plot seeds to drop early
- **The Muster’s talent**: Ben’s “muster” is not just charisma—he possesses (knowingly or not) a fragment of an oath that compels desperate sailors to follow.
- **A mutiny that isn’t**: a “mutiny” rumor is being planted by the Company to justify seizing the sloop under salvage/insurance law.
- **Navy informant on board**: one crew member is feeding info, but they’re doing it to pay for a family member’s release.

## Future arcs (pick 1–2 to foreground)
### Arc A: The Company’s Golden Net (levels/sessions 1–6)
- Jobs offered with generous terms.
- Each job increases dependence: supplies, repairs, pardons.
- Reveal: Quell’s contracts include occult fine print—**oath clauses**.

### Arc B: Hunt for the Drowned Ledger (1–8)
- Clues in logbooks, wrecks, and Tideborn shrines.
- The Ledger can erase a debt… by assigning it elsewhere.
- Finale choice: destroy it (release chaos) or control it (become what you hate).

### Arc C: The Blackwake Vote (3–10)
- Rival captains convene to name a Pirate Prince/Princess.
- Ben is nominated (useful symbol) or targeted (threat).
- Outcome reshapes safe harbors and bounties.

### Arc D: The Deep Stirs (mid/late campaign)
- Gallowsweather expands; ship-ghosts increase.
- Tideborn Covenant fractures: appease vs. sever.
- Endgame: renew the bind (sacrifice), break it (freedom + horror), or bargain (new sea law).

## Tools: faction understandable reactions
- If players **hit Company cargo**: Company offers “amnesty” then sends contract-privateers.
- If players **kill Navy officers**: bounty spikes; ports tighten; informants paid.
- If players **pay crew well**: morale rises; recruitment easy; rivals notice.
- If players **use witchcraft publicly**: Tideborn approach with demands; common folk fear them.
